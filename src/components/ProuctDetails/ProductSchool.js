          Our School Management System is designed to bring all academic and 
          administrative operations into one platform â€“ from student admissions, 
          attendance, timetable, and examinations to staff management and parent 
          communication. With real-time data, online fee collection, and reporting, 
          schools can reduce manual tasks, improve efficiency, and focus more on 
          quality education.
